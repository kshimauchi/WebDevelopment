Depending on your operating system and version you may need a couple changes:

ingress-srv.yaml, needs to either update like here: for v1.22

and also if your using windows you have to trick you posts.com, using the windows etc to reroute it to the local host 127.0.0.1 posts.com basically you add it as a rule

if you on linux you may do the same through
the routes.

only for development purposes
